          <div class="box">
            <p>Spending less time outdoors in the past couple years developed a bad habit of doomscrolling within me. I found myself spending hours at night scrolling and refreshing my Twitter feed, consuming content until I passed out.</p>

              <p>Recent studies referenced by The National Center for Health Research suggest that people who frequently use social media feel less happy with life. It can severely interfere with your dopamine levels.</p>

        </div>
<p>Connecting myself with the real world helped immensely. Taking time off of the internet to read more books, play more music, and talk to my family members more made me feel less paranoid about things and lowered my FOMO(fear of missing out) significantly.</p>

          <p>As tempting as it may be to stay up to "degen hours", your body needs adequate sleep. Without it, you're more likely to feel worse overall: you're more prone to mood swings, your memory can be spotty, and you can struggle to focus, among other things.</p>

            <p>As cliche as the phrase "it's okay not to be okay" is, it's the truth! Make sure you take time for yourself to check in with your emotional and mental state. Give yourself time to process things(and sometimes, it's okay to just make time to do nothing! Treat yourself <3).</p>
